\chapter{Next steps} \label{ch:conclusion}

As a conclusion of this preliminary stage, based on the analysis carried out so far, the implementation of the proposed system appears to be feasible.

As next steps, we intend to refine the analyses conducted so far. In addition, an orbit analysis will be added to determine the number of objects required for different types of orbits. As well as the minimum number of satellites required to achieve a certain accuracy considering a receiver being operated by a user of the system.

We also plan to develop the design of the proposed payload for a possible future implementation and deployment in one of the research group's future missions. To effectively test the proposed system and developed payload, a mission composed of multiple satellites will also be presented and proposed.
