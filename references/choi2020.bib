    abstract = {The Korean government has a plan to build a new regional satellite navigation system called the Korean Positioning System (KPS). The initial KPS constellation is designed to consist of seven satellites, which include three geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellites and four inclined geosynchronous orbit (IGSO) satellites. KPS will provide an independent positioning, navigation, and timing (PNT) service in the Asia-Oceania region and can also be compatible with GPS. In the simulation for KPS, we employ 24 GPS as designed initially and 7 KPS satellites. Compared to the true orbit that we simulated, the averaged root mean square (RMS) values of orbit-only signal-in-space ranging errors (SISRE) are approximately 4.3 and 3.9 cm for KPS GEO and IGSO. Two different positioning solutions are analyzed to demonstrate the KPS performance. KPS standard point positioning (SPP) errors in the service area are about 4.7, 3.9, and 7.1 m for east (E), north (N), and up (U) components, respectively. The combined KPS+GPS SPP accuracy can be improved by 25.0%, 31.8%, and 35.0% compared to GPS in E, N, and U components. The averaged position errors for KPS kinematic precise point positioning (KPPP) are less than 10 cm. In the fringe of the KPS service area, however, the position RMS errors can reach about 40 cm. Unlike KPS, GPS solutions show high positioning accuracy in the KPS service area. The combined KPS+GPS can be improved by 28.7%, 27.1%, and 30.5% compared to GPS in E, N, and U components, respectively. It is noted that KPS can provide better performance with GPS in the Asia-Oceania region.},
